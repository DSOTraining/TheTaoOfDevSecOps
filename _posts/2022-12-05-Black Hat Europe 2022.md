The last few weeks have been buzzing with several conferences held in London.  I had the opportunity to attend the following in November:
- [Kubernetes Community Days UK 2002](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-uk-presents-kubernetes-community-days-uk-2022/)
- [YOW! London 2022](https://yowlondon.com/2022/)
  
To kick start December, we have the annual Black Hat Europe held at the Excel London.  With the Elizabeth line now operational, it makes getting to the venue so much easier.

I love the hallway tracks at any event, but I also love to target the broad range of talks to expand and widen my exposure to this complex security domain. Here are a few I would like to share:

#
 
### Keynote - Our Kryptonite: A Defendable Internet

[Daniel Cuthbert](https://twitter.com/dcuthbert) is very active and a leading figure in security, so what a great way to kick off the event with him reflecting on the talk delivered by Thomas Dullien (aka @halvarflake) titled ‚ÄúWhy We Are Not Building a Defendable Internet‚Äù and exploring where should we be heading going forward.

### Fail Harder: Finding Critical 0-Days in Spite of Ourselves
Most talks focus on the happy path of finding 0-Days, but what about all the other attempts which did not work?  In this talk, [Douglas McKee](https://twitter.com/fulmetalpackets) and [Philippe Laulheret](https://twitter.com/phLaul) will share the challenges they faced, and the numerous attempts tried before unlocking their achievement.

### Back-connect to the Connected Car. Search for Vulnerabilities in the VW Electric Car.
Everything is code, everything is connected seems to reflect the modern world.  Electric cars are now a new frontier for security researchers and attackers. The team from NavInfo walks us through their penetration testing journey against the Volkswagen EVs.

### Confidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security Operations
Shifting left is all the rage over the last few years, but security operations are still very important.  It has been a good few years since I have worked in this space, so looking forward to digesting some of the latest insights from this talk to play a bit of catch-up. 

### Scammers Who Scam Scammers, Hackers Who Hack Hackers: Exploring a Hidden Sub-economy on Cybercrime Forums and Marketplaces
Understanding or gaining insight into the dark world of adversary is always fascinating.  This presentation seems to share another layer of complexity.  Should be a fun talk.

There are quite a few more talks on my hit list, but people love top 5 and top 10 lists ü§ì. If you will be attending do look out for me even just to say hi.
