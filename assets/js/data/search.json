In the past, travelling to Excel was a bit troublesome, but I used the new Elizabeth (tube) line and it was a breeze - less congestion and a lot quicker; at least coming in from King‚Äôs Cross train station.Black Hat was held at the far end of the conference centre so it was a bit of a walk from the station. The Registration area was sandwiched between the Business Hall (vendor stands situated on the lower ground floor) and the briefings (main talks) on the third floor. The sponsor (vendor-centric) talks and Arsenal (demonstration area of open source tools) were co-located in the Business Hall. This layout was very convenient.Here are some of my colleagues looking after the Veracode stand at the event.Choosing What Sessions To Attend Was TrickyAs part of my preparation, I shortlisted the talks I wanted to potentially attend over the two days - some overlapped so I had to make tough choices. You can find my choice of ‚ÄòThe Top 5 Application Security Sessions to Attend‚Äô in my other blog.The lineup on the first day attracted me more. One session was ‚ÄúBack-connect to the Connected Car. Search for Vulnerabilities in the VW Electric Car‚Äù delivered by Yuriy Serdyuk and Alexey Kondikov from the NavInfo Europe Cybersecurity Team. They presented a collection of weaknesses they discovered from various systems controlling the car. An example of one, which stood out for me, was the weakness relating to the software update process - it was a real OMG moment for me as this type of issue is not new in system design. Essentially, they discovered that it was possible to initiate a software system update via USB and the update scripts were executed under the context of root; both are potentially acceptable techniques however the critical point which underpinned this weakness was having no validation of the scripts and binary artefacts. This all leads back to the importance of securing your operational and maintenance workflows to be factored into your design and is an example of what is now coined Software Supply Chain Security.For those who are interested in standards relating to the car industry, there are two regulations from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) for you to reference and digest: UN Regulation No. 155 - Cyber security and cyber security management system UN Regulation No. 156 - Software update and software update management systemIt‚Äôs been a while since I worked with a Security Operations Centre (SOC) and so the session titled ‚ÄúConfidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security Operations‚Äù by Kathryn Knerle and Carson Zimmerman allowed me to play catch up with the world of Operational Security and how the SOC has evolved since I was last involved in this domain. The talk covered some of the changes and key areas contained in the freely published reference 11 Strategies of a World Class Cybersecurity Operations Center.It is always wonderful for experts in their own field to collate and share their domain knowledge with the wider industry through the creation of an in-depth publication - sharing is caring.Key Highlights From the EventBoth keynotes were the highlights for me as they reflected on the journey the security industry has taken and what we can do going forward.Daniel Cuthbert‚Äôs (@dcuthbert) keynote delivery was amazing. ChatGPT is all the rave and he used this to help generate his slide deck and talk.He used the term ‚Äúincentive‚Äù a number of times and this resonated with me a lot. It seems despite security professionals beating the drum to make things secure we were not really enabling this to happen. For example, we (tech in general) love to use fancy names which push people (outside the domain) away; another is stupefying the situation by fixing the problem as it is quicker to do this as opposed to showing/educating the person facing the challenge. I see this a lot and it is no wonder why for non-security individuals there is ‚Äúno incentive to build secure products‚Äù.Jen Ellis (@Infosecjen) keynote and afternoon talk, with Irfan Hemani (@irfanhemani), also resonated with me a lot as the topic was specific about what the UK Government are doing to improve cyber security for the country and the industry.Daniel captured the essence of the talk very well in his live tweet.Here are some key slides from the talk. Interesting fact, in 2022 there were 16 ransomware incidents which invoked COBRA meetings indicating how serious the situation was for the UK government to have held these sessions. Further details from the UK NCSC Annual Review 2022 can be found here.Jen stated that one of her key objectives for her talks was to inspire and provoke action to help shape the future of security in collaboration with your government (not exclusive to the UK). She has definitely piqued my interest to understand further what is happening in this space.Here are a couple of areas which I will dig into more AppSec and Privacy Code of Practice and Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill.Final ThoughtsHaving attended different conferences over the last three weeks I noticed that the last day always seems to be very lightly attended. It is December 2022, so I guess we are still adapting to the new world we live in with people‚Äôs working practices and attending in-person events. 2023 will be another stage for us all. I hope I have the opportunity to continue to meet you wonderful folks in the new year and for us to share our experiences.Reflecting upon the current techno landscape we work and live in, software security has never been more important. Defining the ‚Äúright amount‚Äù of security for your business is challenging. Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) continues to be a hot topic and it is excellent that the UK government is actively ‚Äúimproving this‚Äù. An element of SSCS is the Software Bill of Material (SBOM). If you like to hear me discuss this with industry representatives then check out my webinar organised by Veracode.And finally, it is always a geeky moment to see Chris Wysopal (@WeldPond), as part of L0pht, being referenced in talks." }, { "title": "Black Hat Europe 2022:The Top 5 Application Security Sessions to Attend", "url": "/posts/Black-Hat-Europe-2022/", "categories": "conference, blackhat, BHEU, community", "tags": "conference, blackhat, BHEU, community", "date": "2022-12-05 12:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "The last few weeks have been buzzing with several conferences held in London. I had the opportunity to attend the following in November: Kubernetes Community Days UK 2002 YOW! London 2022To kick start December, we have the annual Black Hat Europe held at the Excel London. With the Elizabeth line now operational, it makes getting to the venue so much easier.I love the hallway tracks at any event, but I also love to target the broad range of talks to expand and widen my exposure to this complex security domain. Here are a few I would like to share:Keynote - Our Kryptonite: A Defendable InternetDaniel Cuthbert is very active and a leading figure in security, so what a great way to kick off the event with him reflecting on the talk delivered by Thomas Dullien (aka @halvarflake) titled ‚ÄúWhy We Are Not Building a Defendable Internet‚Äù and exploring where should we be heading going forward.Fail Harder: Finding Critical 0-Days in Spite of OurselvesMost talks focus on the happy path of finding 0-Days, but what about all the other attempts which did not work? In this talk, Douglas McKee and Philippe Laulheret will share the challenges they faced, and the numerous attempts tried before unlocking their achievement.Back-connect to the Connected Car. Search for Vulnerabilities in the VW Electric Car.Everything is code, everything is connected seems to reflect the modern world. Electric cars are now a new frontier for security researchers and attackers. The team from NavInfo walks us through their penetration testing journey against the Volkswagen EVs.Confidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security OperationsShifting left is all the rage over the last few years, but security operations are still very important. It has been a good few years since I have worked in this space, so looking forward to digesting some of the latest insights from this talk to play a bit of catch-up.Scammers Who Scam Scammers, Hackers Who Hack Hackers: Exploring a Hidden Sub-economy on Cybercrime Forums and MarketplacesUnderstanding or gaining insight into the dark world of adversary is always fascinating. This presentation seems to share another layer of complexity. Should be a fun talk.There are quite a few more talks on my hit list, but people love top 5 and top 10 lists ü§ì. If you will be attending do look out for me even just to say hi." }, { "title": "100 Days at Veracode", "url": "/posts/100DaysAtVeracode/", "categories": "work, life, career, evangelist, advocate, consultant", "tags": "work, life, career, evangelist, advocate, consultant", "date": "2022-07-10 12:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "I have been an independent consultant for the best part of two decades and I have had the pleasure to work at some great businesses - check out my LinkedIn to see who. About ten years ago I crashed into the DevOps movement and with my security background I like to claim I sparked off the DevSecOps movement (exaggeration). In reality, what I did was, I had a mid life crisis inspiration and started a community meetup called DevSecOps - London Gathering (back in September 2017). I was inspired by a conference called DevSecCon; thank you Francois for starting this great conference and indirectly kicking me to do something and allowing me to break out of my comfort zone. I have now moved on from the meet-up, but please continue to attend and provide feedback - I know the new organisers will love this.So bringing this back to the present time. I am now, no longer an independent consultant and have recently joined a company called Veracode as a permie - I know, who would of guessed.When you join any company you always come across a mix of pleasant people and a few peeps you do not gel with - that‚Äôs life. I must confess, I can be a difficult person to work with (my wife tells me this üòÖ). Cliche: but after 100 days of being a Veracoder I have not meet anyone I do not like.During my first month - actually my first week, I took part in the Sales Kick Off event held in Boston, USA. This was very daunting and welcoming at the sametime - all be it with the world opening back up from COVID and for most of us not having done any international travelling for 2 years. As part of this event, I co-presented with one of my colleague and delivered the talk to a couple hundred of Veracoders including the CEO - Sam King. She quietly sat at the back and I guess some of my frank comments compelled her to quiz us at the end. My thoughts - MM you are now on her radar or hit list ü§™.What happened next was amazing and my first ‚Äòaha‚Äô moment in Veracode. She wanted us to repeat the talk to some other folks in the company - turns out to be the Exec team. Sam made me feel that all thoughts and opinions are welcome in the company and should be shared to challenge the status quo. Amazing!!! ‚ÄúWe are committed to making progress together‚Äù ‚ÄúWe value each other‚ÄùAs part of my new role, being a consultant/evangelist/advocate (take your pick), one of my challenges is to make sure my colleagues are better equipped with engaging with prospects and customers. This is not the technical aspect of the solution, my Solution Architect colleagues can handle that, but more about understanding our past - the evolution of both the security and development industry over the last decade or so - in order to appreciate the current challenges that businesses face, and therefore engage with context and empathy rather than just selling a product.Buzzword bingo: shift left release faster cloud native devsecopsAfterall, we are here to enable companies to deliver business applications within their risk tolerance.Here are some of the ‚Äúcrazy ideas‚Äù i initiated: I formed the Veracode Library. I managed to even get one of the authors to come in and sign the copies of their book. Thank you Glenn for doing this üëçüôèü§ù. I have been running AMA sessions, have one to one meetings with individual and attend some team calls as a guest. I have encouraged them to socialise and mingle with peers outside of the company e.g. meetups and conferences. So if you meet some Veracoders in the wild than please talk to them - they are nice people, trust me I too am ‚Äúa nice guy‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe help our customers change the world‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have a passion and committment for security‚ÄùThe above are some of the internal activities, so what about the external stuff! Well, I have hosted private Hot Topic Gatherings where I invite three to four companies to discuss a topic that they each can relate to. The first, was title ‚ÄúThe Modern Challenges of an AppSec Programme‚Äù.This went down really well (I would say this ü§ì). Here‚Äôs some feedback from one of the attendees that I received:&amp;gt; I really liked talking amongst a smaller group rather than the meetup format which are good to learn from but tend to be broadcasted rather than holding conversations until the pub after where they aren‚Äôt so good anyway. Just wish I‚Äôd taken some notes on key ideas from others to try.So, if you feel you have a hot topic to discuss with peers, please reach out to me and we can explore if I can faciliate this. The format of the event takes place in a private room, e.g. it has been held in the boardroom of the Veracode‚Äôs London office, but I can find other suitable places as well. I then kick off the event with the usual pleasantries and then I ask one of the company members to share their view and it spirals out from there. Although the event is run by me and hosted by Veracode it is not a pitching session - you are safe in my hands üòà.In my short tenure, I have had the opportunity to attend two conferences: KubeCon EU and We Are Developers. These two events allowed me to appreciate, IRL, what people are currently passionate about as the attendees from each come from different technical backgrounds and the focuses are very different. The next conference I will be attending is taking place in London, DevOpsDays London - so please come and find me.Naturally, as we start to venture out, statistically it was inevitable I would catch COVID. As always, these challenges happens at the most awkward of times, as I tested positive two days before I was meant to take my wife to the airport. Taking a taxi was the only choice for her, but my company looked after me and offered to take on this cost !!!. This very kind gesture melted me (yes I am very sentimental).So if I can summarise my first ‚Äú100 days at Veracode‚Äù, then I feel comfortable ‚Ä¶ publicly ‚Ä¶ saying ‚Ä¶ I am proud to be a Veracoder. ‚ÄúWe are proud to be Veracode‚ÄùThe Veracode WayYou will have noticed a few quotes and these represents ‚ÄúThe Veracode Way‚Äù, they are the guiding principles that we follow.Here‚Äôs the complete list.`We have a passion and committment for security``We help our customers change the world``We have big goals and expect big outcomes``We are committed to making progress together``We value each other``We are proud to be Veracode`" }, { "title": "Continuous Learning 2022", "url": "/posts/Continuous-Learning/", "categories": "conferences, meetup, events, community, book, podcast", "tags": "conferences, meetup, community, events, book, podcast", "date": "2022-06-19 12:00:00 +0100", "snippet": " This post is pinned as I will be updating this on the fly as and when I attend/discover or like/dislike events.So which one next?Let‚Äôs wait until the new year to see what‚Äôs in store.

This was my first in-person KubeCon and the first time for visiting this beautiful Spanish city.The conference gathers adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities. Approximately 7,000 people attended the event in-person and another 10,000 online.Later this year KubeCon + CloudNativeCon moves to Detroit for the North America event, from October 25-28, 2022, while next year‚Äôs Europe event will be hosted in Amsterdam on April 17-21, 2023.Fun factsBefore digging into the serious stuff, I think it would be nice to mention some interesting fun facts. Here you go: The event was a reconfirmation that cool swag, like stickers, t-shirts, tote bags, is a magnet to any stand. I did not get COVID. Check out #KubeCovid for some reports on Twitter. Valencia is a beautiful city with lovely restaurants. If you love Japanese food, check out Kabuki Komori.Meeting peopleIn-person events are great and you finally can talk to real people (how I missed that the past two years!). Above all, it is wonderful meeting end-users and re-establishing relationship with customers and friends.A great Hallway Track, was me intentionally bumping into Styra‚Äôs CEO, Bill Mann (we kinda have the same surname). We chatted about the state of the industry, their Open Policy Agent solution and exchanged views regarding the conference.I also had the pleasure to meet some of the key people in the CNCF Security Technical Advisory Group. I look forward with becoming more involve with the team and the acitivites within the EU region - thanks Emily and Andy.HighlightsI‚Äôm sure you can guess, the most discussed topic at KubeCon was supply chain attacks - keynote from Spotify. 2021 was dominated by such attacks and their impact can be devastating. As businesses are more and more reliant on software components delivered through vast and complex supply chains, the impact of gaps and vulnerabilities in these components becomes a pressing challenge. Everyone is concerned about the issue and every vendor had a solution to offer to tackle the problem.Besides supply chains, a topic that really perked my attention was the eBPF technology. eBPF is a technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in an operating system kernel. It is used to extend the capabilities of the kernel safely and efficiently without changing kernel source code or load kernel modules. eBPF can be leveraged in many use cases, such as monitoring your data flows or implementing security policies. Since eBPF deploys in the host where containers are running, it helps overcome the mental resistance of deploying a software tool inside the app stack. Here is Liz‚Äôs talk at SecurityCon KubeCon EU on the subject.Another topic that made an impression on me is how women role models can help diversity not only in cybersecurity but also in the software development industry. For example, when I was with Liz Rice and others taking in the sun after the conference one evening, a young lady cam up to us to thank Liz for inspiring her career and instilled confidence in her to develop and showcase her technical skills. This is great, and I would love to see more diverse workspaces in tech driven companies.Final thoughtsThe overall experience of KubeCon Europe 2022 was rewarding. However, there are a few lessons I learnt that can be useful for everyone planning to attend similar events. Reviewing and highlighting which talks to attend is important, but be prepared to improvise with hallway chats - they tend to turn out to be more insightful. If this scene is new to you, it is best to pair up with someone. Please look me up if you would like some company :-) Finally, compile a list of lovely restaurants to hit up and enjoy the company you have gathered.I look forward to seeing you at the next KubeCon.My wrap up of KubeCon EU 2022" } ]
